# There are basically three components in Linux. ASK...which stands for Application, Shell and Kernel. This is my approach of remembering the architecture. 

Kernel is a program which is written in C Language.
We will write shell commands in shell. Shell will communicate with Kernel and transalte for kernel in a understandable langugage. Then kernel will communicate with Hardware and perform the operations.

Applications -> Notepad, vim
Inside Kernel their is a Hardware -> Hard Disk, Monitor, RAM
